### What I learned

I've learnt how to use CSS Grids to create to create two columns for the product image and product information
```html <div class="grid"><gid>
```css grid{
  display:grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 15px;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 700px; 

I've also learnt how to use media queries to create a responsive product preview card
